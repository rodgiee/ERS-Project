# Egyptian Rat Screw pygame
**What is Egyptian Rat Screw?**: 

ERS is a face-paced card game where players will race to slap cards in the middle based on pattern!


This project aims to recreate ERS in python where the visuals are handled by the pygame module

**How do I play?**:


`P` key to place cards once it is your turn


`space` key to slap in!

*Current patterns include*:


- Pair (2 consecutive cards of same value)


- Sandwich (2 cards of same value with a random card in between)
