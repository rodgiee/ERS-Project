# Egyptian Rat Screw pygame
**What is Egyptian Rat Screw?**: 

ERS is a face-paced card game where players will race to slap cards in the middle based on pattern!


This project aims to recreate ERS in python where visuals are handled by the pygame module and gameplay mechanics are multithreaded.

**How do I play?**:
