## Egyptian Rat Screw pygame
**What is Egyptian Rat Screw?**: 

ERS is a face-paced card game where players will race to slap cards in the middle based on pattern!


This project aims to recreate ERS using pygame (python) and threading!

**How do I play?**:


`P` key to place cards once it is your turn


`space` key to slap in!

Current patterns include:


- Pair (2 consecutive cards of same value)


- Sandwich (2 cards of same value with a random card in between)
